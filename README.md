Are you tired of the uncertainty and risk associated with trying out new cosmetics? Choosing the right beauty products can be a daunting task, especially if you have sensitive skin or are prone to skin troubles. The information you need to make an informed decision is right there on the back of each product, but deciphering those complex ingredient lists can be challenging, even for those without a background in chemistry. If you can relate to this struggle, you're in the right place.

**Introducing the Cosmetics Recommendation System!**

In this project, we harness the power of data science to help you predict which cosmetic products may be the perfect fit for your unique needs. We've developed a content-based recommendation system that focuses on the chemical components of cosmetics. By processing ingredient lists from a vast selection of 1472 cosmetics available on Sephora, we utilize word embedding techniques to capture the essence of these products' ingredients.

## Key Project Objectives:
- **Data Processing:** Extract and preprocess ingredient lists from 1472 cosmetic products on Sephora.
- **Word Embedding:** Utilize advanced natural language processing techniques to represent chemical components effectively.
- **Similarity Visualization:** Employ t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) to visualize ingredient similarity in an interpretable manner.
- **Interactive Visualization:** Utilize the Bokeh library to create an interactive and user-friendly ingredient similarity visualization tool.

Say goodbye to blind purchases and skin troubles. Let data science guide you towards the cosmetics that are most likely to suit your preferences and skin type. Explore, compare, and discover new products with confidence!
